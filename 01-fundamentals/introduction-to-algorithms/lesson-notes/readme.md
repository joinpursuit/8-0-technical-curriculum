# Introduction to Algorithms

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Define the term algorithm.
- Write algorithms in plain English to solve for everyday problems.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What is an algorithm? Define it in your own words.

- Many algorithms require an input. What does the term "input" mean in this context?

- What are some examples of algorithms that you perform on a regular basis?

- What does the "happy path" refer to when talking about algorithms?

- What is an edge case?

- Imagine you've taken a photo with your phone that you want to have printed out, so that you have a physical copy. What algorithm could be used to accomplish this process? Define the input, output, and set of steps you'd need to follow, assuming the "happy path."

  There are many ways to solve this problem, so feel free to be creative.

- Are there any edge cases to the algorithm you came up with? How can you account for one or two of them?
