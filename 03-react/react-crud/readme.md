# React CRUD

Until now, you've learned how to use React to render content using JavaScript. You've seen how React allows you to integrate external APIs into your page and how you can make React applications feel like complex websites through routing.

You may be surprised to learn that there's not much else to React than what you've learned so far. Much of the challenge as you advance will be to synthesize what you have learned and apply it to increasingly complex projects.

That said, building a typical application you might see on the web is quite complex if you start from scratch. In this lesson, you'll focus on learning about the key actions on just about every website. Doing so will get you prepared for building all kinds of applications.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the concept of a resource and how it relates to programming.
- Describe the concept of CRUD and how it relates to programming more generally.
- Identify the four most common page types and their purpose.

## A quick review

Recall why you're learning React and how it will interact with other parts of a complete application.

- When you go to a URL, you access data from a server. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (i.e., React) are sent from the server to your browser, which renders it to you.
- When you interact on a web application, more requests are sent back to the server. Some of these requests to the server are then sent to a database, where information is stored.
- Data stored in the database is requested by the server, which then serves that information up to your browser.

Using Spotify as an example, when you add a new song to a playlist through the browser version of Spotify
You interact with the app (click on a song and then click to add it to a playlist)
This interaction triggered two things:
The update of the page to show a successful interaction
Send a request to a server that will update the data (This will allow the playlist to be updated everywhere, not just in the browser)

This concert of requests and promises allows you to have a unique experience on a website. React allows you to build a rich and complex front-end experience for your user. However, it also needs to play its part in facilitating this concert of requests.

### The big picture

Consider some of the external APIs you've used in the past. Thus far, you've sent them GET requests -- that is, you've requested data from their servers to display on your page.

For example, consider the [Veterinarian API](https://github.com/joinpursuit/resource-veterinarian-api) you may have used in previous labs. This API allows you to retrieve data about staff and clients for a veterinarian hospital.

However, imagine you want to build an application that doesn't just display information but _modifies it._ How can you add new clients? Change the titles of existing staff?

This lesson will be the first of many to show you how to do the above. In doing so, you'll be able to build real complex applications that are highly interactive and responsive to users.

## Resources

Remember that code represents real processes and concepts in the real world. For example, when you go to an online store, you typically add "products" to your "cart" before placing an "order" to purchase those products. Based on the "address" you've stored in the "account" you've created, a new "delivery" may be made to track your shipment.

Each of these concepts could be a resource. A resource is typically a conceptual representation that has a set of properties with different potential values. Typically, resources are also something you want to "save" or store.

For example, an online store might have dozens of products. Each of these products is different in that they may have other names, colors, weights, costs, images, and more. And yet, they are all similar in that they can all be purchased in the same way. In this example, "Products" are a resource. Each individual "product" shares the same structure (e.g., having a name, color, and price property), but each is likely to differ from other products.

### Some examples

The concept of a resource can feel quite abstract. However, you're likely interacting with many resources whenever you interact with a complex web application.

- Your learning management system has a resource of "assignments." Each assignment differs from the others. But they all share qualities, such as having a title and a grade.
- A "post" on a social media site is yet another resource. The content of each post can differ widely, but they share some of the same properties, such as having content, a timestamp, and an author.
- If you watch "movies" or "shows" through an online media service, you can think of each movie or show as a resource. Their content is different, but they have similar properties, such as titles and lengths.

## Create, Read, Update, and Delete

For many web applications, the entire purpose is to interact with resources. Social media sites are a good example of this. Social media "posts" don't do anything on their own. They are meant to be created, looked at, and occasionally updated or deleted. That is their entire purpose.

This standard set of interactions is called CRUD, representing the actions of create, read, update, and delete.

CRUD actions appear all over the place in programming, as programmers often work with the concept of resources.

### CRUD in the command line

One place you have already seen CRUD actions is on the command line. For example, consider the resource of a "file". Specific commands allow you to perform the CRUD action via the command line.

| Action | Command         | Effect                             |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Create | `touch`         | Creates a new file.                |
| Read   | `cat` or `less` | Reads the contents of a file.      |
| Update | `mv`            | Allows for the renaming of a file. |
| Delete | `rm`            | Deletes a file.                    |

You can perform these same actions on the command line:

| Action | Command        | Effect                                              |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Create | `mkdir`        | Creates a new directory.                            |
| Read   | `ls <dirname>` | Lists out the contents of a directory.              |
| Update | `mv`           | Allows for moving a file from and to the directory. |
| Delete | `rmdir`        | Deletes a directory.                                |

Other commands can have similar actions to the ones above. For example, `>` and `>>` can append text to files, while `rm` can also delete a directory.

### CRUD in JavaScript

You've also performed CRUD commands on JavaScript objects. Consider how you can manipulate object key-value pairs.

| Action | Syntax                   | Effect                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create | `obj[key] = "value"`     | Creates a new key-value pair on an existing object.            |
| Read   | `obj[key]`               | Accesses the value of a particular key in an object.           |
| Update | `obj[key] = "new value"` | Replaces an existing value with a new value for the given key. |
| Delete | `delete obj[key]`        | Removes the key-value pair from the object.                    |

The example above shows that the syntax for creating and updating a key-value pair is the same. The vital point is that all these actions are possible on an object.

### CRUD in APIs

APIs also typically make use of the CRUD actions. So far, you're likely comfortable with building requests using the `GET` method. This method tells the server that you want to read data. Other methods indicate different kinds of actions to perform.

The URL path is also essential. For example, take a look at the following path.

```
GET /api/products
```

The above indicates to a server that you want to read (i.e., access) information about the products from the API.

> **Note:** While the above is a _typical_ case, you should always read the documentation for an API to understand best how to interact with it.

| Action | HTTP Method/Verb | Effect                               |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Create | `POST`           | Create a new resource.               |
| Read   | `GET`            | Access information about a resource. |
| Update | `PUT` or `PATCH` | Update information about a resource. |
| Delete | `DELETE`         | Destroy a resource.                  |

Your front-end applications will use the methods above to interact with APIs, allowing you to build robust applications.

## Common page types

The above section describes four key "actions" that interact with resources. You typically will not see those actions when viewing a webpage as a user. Instead, you will often see one of the types of pages below. Each of these pages is typically associated with one or more resources and enables different kinds of actions.

### Index

The first, most common type of page is an Index page. The purpose of an Index page is to show many versions of a resource. You can think of it as a list of a resource.

Index pages will always take the read action to access several resources and display them to the user.

For example, take a look at the following page from Brilliant.org.

![Multiple course view from Brilliant.org.](./assets/brilliant-index.png)

The image above is an Index page for courses. There are two ways you can tell this:

1. The URL path is `/courses`. While this won't be true for every website, many websites follow a convention where they put the resource name in the URL. This "courses" page shows all courses. Therefore the path is `/courses`.

1. Multiple courses are being shown. You can see here that Brilliant organizes the courses by popularity. However, this doesn't change the fact that this is an Index page.

Index pages are the "storefront" for a particular resource. It allows the user to view multiple resources and choose what to do next.

Not all index pages are created equal. The image below is from Amazon and shows multiple products. However, you can see that their URL doesn't indicate what you're looking at, and their page is a bit busier.

![Amazon Index page of products.](./assets/amazon-index.png)

### Show

A Show page features a single resource. Unlike the Index page, which reads multiple, show pages typically read a single resource.

That's it! Take a look at the following Show page for a Brilliant.org course.

![Brilliant course show page.](./assets/brilliant-show.png)

The page above shows more details on the Computer Science Fundamentals course. The purpose of this page is to highlight and display that resource and allow the user to interact with it.

This same concept can be seen on Amazon when looking at a particular product page.

![Amazon product page.](./assets/amazon-show.png)

In the image above, a single product is highlighted from Amazon.

### New

A New page is any page where you can create a new resource. For example, you're likely familiar with the following New page.

![New GitHub repository page.](./assets/github-new.png)

The image above is your page to create a new GitHub repository.

New pages will almost always have a `form` element. When clicking the Submit button, the create action is taken. Then, you are often redirected to the newly created resource's Show page or the overall resource's Index page.

### Edit

An Edit page is similar to a New page, except it modifies an existing resource. For example, the following is Google Calendar's Edit page.

![Page that allows the user to edit a calendar event.](./assets/gcal-edit.png)

Edit pages also typically use forms. The update action is used to modify the resource when you press the Save button in Google Calendar. Then, the user is generally brought back to an Index or Show page.

## Applying this knowledge

You've now seen several examples of the four most common actions (i.e., create, read, update, and delete) and some of the most common pages (i.e., Index, Show, New, Edit). While interesting, you may be wondering how to apply this new knowledge.

First, having a specific language when getting ready to build complex web applications is often helpful. It is not very specific to say that you need to develop "a dashboard". It's much better to say that you need to build "a product Index page that allows a user to delete products and click a button to go to the product New page." Technical language like this is excellent for communicating with team members and for future interviews.

Secondly, if you spend some time looking around at your favorite websites, you'll notice that these concepts often appear. Most pages on many popular applications are just iterations of the concepts you've read about here. And that's helpful to know because you can build all these kinds of pages!

Take a moment to reflect on the screenshots you've seen above. You're capable of repeating elements on the page, displaying images, and generating forms. You're capable of making requests when the page loads or via a button click. And you're capable of reading documentation and asking questions to see how you can interact with an API.

It may not feel like it, but you are ready to build complex front-end applications. You have the knowledge -- now it's time to practice!
