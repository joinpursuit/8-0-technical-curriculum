---

## Guiding questions

- In the reading, you learned about the concept of a "resource." What is a resource?

- Visit the webpage of your learning management system, Canvas. What are some resources you think Canvas has?

- What does CRUD stand for?

- CRUD is a generic concept that can apply in many situations. Keeping that in mind, answer the following questions:

- What CRUD actions can be performed on a file via the command line?

- What CRUD actions can be performed on an array in JavaScript?

- How does CRUD relate to resources?

- What is an HTTP method or verb?

- So far in this class, what method have you used when making external API requests?

- What are the different HTTP methods that are related to CRUD actions?

- Keeping the above in mind, consider the following requests: an HTTP method and a path. Guess what action is used and what the resource is.

- `GET /products`
- `POST /products`
- `PUT /products/99`
- `DELETE /products/11`
- `GET /users/491`
- `PUT /users/491`

- There are four common "kinds" of pages. What are they?

- How is an Index page different from a Show page?

- How is an Edit page different from a New page?

- The following bullet points each have a description of a page. Based on the description, identify what common page is represented and what actions are being taken or are capable of being taken.

Keep in mind that this can often be subjective. Focus on explaining your reasoning as opposed to just getting it right!

- A form to submit a new post to a social media network.

- A page that shows a series of shows you can watch online.

- A sign-up form for a website.

- A page with the most popular images you've posted to social media in the past.

- A page that allows you to set timed alarms. The page also includes a button next to each alarm that enables you to delete the alarm.

- A page with a to-do list that contains a list of tasks to be completed. The user can fill out a form on the top with new tasks. When it is submitted, the new task appears on the list.
